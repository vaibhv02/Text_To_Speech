## Explanation

This project uses IBM Watson's Text-to-Speech API to convert text into spoken words. By integrating IBM Watson's powerful AI capabilities, the project allows you to input any text string and generate a corresponding speech audio file in MP3 format.

The script begins by setting up authentication using your IBM Watson API key and service URL. Once authenticated, you can pass any text to the `synthesize` method, which converts the text to speech. The synthesized speech is then saved as an audio file (`speech.mp3`) in the project directory.

This project is useful for anyone looking to explore text-to-speech technology or needing to generate speech audio from text programmatically.

## Skills Used

- **Python Programming:** Writing Python scripts to interact with APIs, handle file operations, and manage dependencies.
- **API Integration:** Integrating with IBM Watson's Text-to-Speech API, including setting up authentication and sending requests.
- **Text-to-Speech Technology:** Understanding and utilizing text-to-speech conversion techniques to generate speech from text.
- **File Handling:** Saving the synthesized speech as an audio file in MP3 format.
- **Dependency Management:** Managing project dependencies using `pip` and ensuring that all required packages are installed.
