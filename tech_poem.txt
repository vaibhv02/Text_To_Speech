In realms of circuits, bright and vast,
Where bytes of thought blend with the past,
AI whispers in digital dreams,
Unraveling the future's seams.

Through silicon veins, knowledge flows,
Where algorithms learn and prose,
In the language of zeros and ones,
Echoes of innovation's drums.

Technology's heartbeat, fierce and bold,
A symphony of stories told,
From quantum realms to cyberspace,
Unveiling wonders, time can't erase.

So let the voices rise and sing,
Of AI's grace and what it brings,
In the realm where dreams take flight,
In the dance of pixels, day and night.
